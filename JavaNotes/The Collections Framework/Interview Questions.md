### **Java Collections Framework Interview Questions and Answers**

#### **1. What is the Java Collections Framework, and why is it important?**
**Answer:**  
The Java Collections Framework is a set of interfaces and classes that provide a well-structured way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in Java. It is important because:
- It provides efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
- It includes common data structures like `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`, and their implementations.
- It improves code reusability and maintainability by offering standardized implementations of data structures.

#### **2. What are the main categories of interfaces in the Java Collections Framework?**
**Answer:**  
The Collections Framework has two main interface categories:
- **Collection Interface (java.util.Collection)**: It includes subinterfaces like `List`, `Set`, and `Queue`. It is used for storing and iterating over elements.
- **Map Interface (java.util.Map)**: It represents a key-value pair data structure, similar to a dictionary.

Additionally, the framework also includes:
- **Queue Interface (java.util.Queue)**: Used for queue-based operations (FIFO, LIFO).
- **Iterator Interface (java.util.Iterator)**: Provides a way to iterate over collections.

#### **3. What is the difference between Collection and Collections in Java?**
**Answer:**  
- **Collection** is an interface that represents a group of objects. It is the root interface of the collection hierarchy.
- **Collections** is a utility class in `java.util` that provides static methods for manipulating collections, such as sorting, searching, and synchronizing.

Example:
```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
Collections.sort(list); // Sorting using Collections utility class
```

#### **4. What are the key updates made to the Collections Framework in Java SE 5 and Java 8?**
**Answer:**  
- **Java SE 5 (JDK 1.5):**
  - Introduced **Generics**, allowing type safety in collections.
  - Added enhanced **for-each loop** for iterating over collections.
- **Java SE 8:**
  - Introduced **Lambda expressions**, allowing functional-style operations on collections.
  - Added **default methods** in interfaces like `List.sort()`, `Map.forEach()`.
  - Introduced **Stream API** for bulk operations on collections.

Example of Lambda expression in Java 8:
```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name)); // Using Lambda
```

#### **5. What is the difference between List, Set, and Map in Java?**
**Answer:**
| Feature  | List | Set | Map |
|----------|------|-----|-----|
| **Duplicates** | Allowed | Not allowed | Keys unique, values can be duplicates |
| **Order** | Maintains insertion order | May or may not maintain order | No order guarantee |
| **Access** | By index | By elements | By key-value pair |
| **Examples** | `ArrayList`, `LinkedList` | `HashSet`, `TreeSet` | `HashMap`, `TreeMap` |

Example of `List`:
```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(10);
list.add(20);
list.add(10); // Duplicates allowed
```

Example of `Set`:
```java
Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
set.add(10);
set.add(20);
set.add(10); // Duplicate ignored
```

Example of `Map`:
```java
Map<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put(1, "Alice");
map.put(2, "Bob");
map.put(1, "Charlie"); // Key updated, no duplicates
```

#### **6. Why is `ArrayList` preferred over `LinkedList` in most cases?**
**Answer:**  
`ArrayList` is preferred over `LinkedList` because:
- It provides **faster random access** (`O(1)`) using an index.
- It has **less memory overhead**, as `LinkedList` requires extra memory for pointers.
- It performs better for **read-heavy** operations.

However, `LinkedList` is useful when:
- Frequent insertions or deletions in the **middle of the list** are required (`O(1)`) as compared to `ArrayList` (`O(n)`).

---

#### **7. Why should `Vector`, `Stack`, and `Hashtable` be avoided in modern Java applications?**
**Answer:**  
- **Vector**: It is synchronized by default, making it **slower** than `ArrayList`. Use `ArrayList` instead.
- **Stack**: Extends `Vector`, which is inefficient. Use `ArrayDeque` instead.
- **Hashtable**: Synchronized and slower compared to `HashMap`. Use `ConcurrentHashMap` in multi-threaded environments.

Example of using `ArrayDeque` instead of `Stack`:
```java
Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
stack.push(10);
stack.push(20);
System.out.println(stack.pop()); // 20
```

#### **8. What are the advantages of using a collection over an array?**
**Answer:**
- **Dynamic Size**: Collections can grow or shrink dynamically, unlike arrays which have a fixed size.
- **Built-in Methods**: Collections provide built-in operations like searching, sorting, and filtering.
- **Type Safety**: With generics, collections ensure type safety, reducing runtime errors.
- **No Manual Resizing**: Collections handle memory allocation automatically.

Example:
```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Java");
list.add("Python");
System.out.println(list.size()); // No need to define size
```

#### **9. What is the difference between `Iterator` and `ListIterator`?**
**Answer:**
| Feature | Iterator | ListIterator |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Traversal** | Forward only | Both forward and backward |
| **Modify List** | No add operation | Can add elements |
| **Index Access** | Not available | Allows index-based operations |
| **Applicable to** | Any collection | Only for `List` implementations |

Example:
```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C"));
ListIterator<String> iterator = list.listIterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println(iterator.next());
}
```

#### **10. How does `ConcurrentHashMap` differ from `HashMap`?**
**Answer:**
- **Thread Safety**: `ConcurrentHashMap` allows multiple threads to read/write concurrently, whereas `HashMap` is **not thread-safe**.
- **Performance**: `ConcurrentHashMap` is faster than `Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>())` because it uses **segmented locking**.
- **Null Values**: `ConcurrentHashMap` does **not allow null keys or values**, whereas `HashMap` allows one null key and multiple null values.

Example:
```java
Map<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
map.put("One", 1);
map.put("Two", 2);
```
