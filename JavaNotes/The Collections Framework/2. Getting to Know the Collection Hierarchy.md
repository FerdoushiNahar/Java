### **Collection Interface Hierarchy**

The Java Collections Framework is built on a hierarchy of interfaces that provide a structured way to manage collections of objects. Below is a summarized breakdown of the key interfaces and their roles.

---

### 🔹 **1. The Iterable Interface**
- The `Iterable` interface is **not part of the Collections Framework** but serves as the **superinterface** of `Collection` and all its subinterfaces.
- Introduced in **Java SE 5 (2004)**, it enables iteration over elements using the **for-each loop**.
- Any class implementing `Iterable` must provide an instance of `Iterator`, which allows iteration over its elements.

### 🔹 **2. The Collection Interface**
- The `Collection` interface is the base interface for storing elements in containers.
- It defines fundamental operations:
  - Adding and removing elements.
  - Checking for element presence.
  - Querying the number of elements and checking if the collection is empty.
  - Performing **set operations** (union, intersection, inclusion, complement).
- Collections provide different ways to access elements:
  - Iterating using an **Iterator**.
  - Creating a **Stream** for parallel processing.

---

### 🔹 **3. Extending Collection with List**
- A `List` **remembers the insertion order** of elements.
- **Indexes** are assigned to elements, allowing:
  - Retrieval of an element by its index.
  - Inserting, replacing, or deleting elements at specific positions.
  - Extracting a range of elements between two indexes.
- Lists guarantee **ordered iteration**.

---

### 🔹 **4. Extending Collection with Set**
- A `Set` ensures **no duplicate elements**.
- Unlike `List`, elements in a `Set` **do not have an index**.
- Adding an element to a `Set` may fail if the element already exists.
- Unlike `List`, `Set` does not introduce new operations, but enforces uniqueness.

---

### 🔹 **5. Sorting Sets with SortedSet and NavigableSet**
- 📌 **SortedSet**:
  - Maintains elements in **ascending order**.
  - Requires elements to be **Comparable** or use a custom **Comparator**.
  - Allows retrieval of the **lowest and highest elements**.
  - Supports extraction of **headSet** (elements less than a given value) and **tailSet** (elements greater than a given value).

- 📌 **NavigableSet**:
  - Extends `SortedSet` with additional functionalities.
  - Allows **descending order iteration**.
  - Provides more navigation methods for element retrieval.

### **Key Differences**
| Feature        | `Collection` | `List`  | `Set`   | `SortedSet` | `NavigableSet` |
|---------------|-------------|---------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Allows Duplicates | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Maintains Order | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ (Some implementations do) | ✅ (Sorted order) | ✅ (Sorted & Navigable) |
| Has Index | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Sorted Automatically | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Reverse Iteration | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

This hierarchy allows developers to choose the most appropriate data structure based on whether they need **ordering, uniqueness, or sorting capabilities**.
