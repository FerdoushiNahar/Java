### 🧠 **What is Type Inference in Java?**
Java can **guess** (infer) the type for generic methods, so you don’t always need to explicitly say what the type is.

---

### 👀 **The Method**
```java
static <T> T pick(T a1, T a2) {
    return a2;
}
```
This is a **generic method** called `pick`.

- It takes **two arguments of the same type `T`**.
- It returns the **second argument**, which is also of type `T`.

---

### 📌 **The Call**
```java
Serializable s = pick("d", new ArrayList<String>());
```

You're calling the method with:
- `"d"` – this is a **String**
- `new ArrayList<String>()` – this is an **ArrayList of Strings**

Now you’re storing the result in a variable of type **Serializable**.

---

### 🧩 **How Java Infers the Type**

Java now has to figure out what type `T` should be:

1. `"d"` is a `String`
2. `new ArrayList<String>()` is an `ArrayList<String>`
3. You're assigning the result to a variable of type `Serializable`

Both `String` and `ArrayList<String>` **implement `Serializable`**.

➡️ So Java thinks: _“Okay, what’s the most specific type that both arguments can become and that matches the return variable?”_

🧠 The answer is: **Serializable**.

So Java says: _“Let’s make `T = Serializable`”_

---

### ✅ **Result**
Now, it works like:
```java
Serializable s = (Serializable) pick((Serializable)"d", (Serializable)new ArrayList<String>());
```

So `pick` returns the second argument → the ArrayList → and it's stored as a `Serializable`.

---

### 🗂️ In Short
- Java sees two different types: `String` and `ArrayList<String>`
- Finds their **common supertype**: `Serializable`
- Infers `T` as `Serializable`
- `pick` returns the second argument → which is fine because it’s a `Serializable`
